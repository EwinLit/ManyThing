The Future of Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century. It has already begun to reshape industries such as healthcare, transportation, and finance. As AI continues to evolve, its potential to revolutionize every aspect of human life grows. However, with its rise comes the need for ethical considerations, such as data privacy and job displacement. In the coming years, we will likely see AI become more integrated into everyday life, possibly even achieving sentience.
