The Amazon rainforest, also known as Amazonia, is a vast tropical rainforest in South America. 
    It covers approximately 5.5 million square kilometers and is home to countless species of flora and fauna, many of which 
    are yet to be discovered. The forest plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and is often referred to as 
    the lungs of the planet.
